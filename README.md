# MECH105_Algorithms
These are all of the MATLAB algorithms I created for my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving class in Spring Semester of 2022 at Colordao State University.
There are five different algorithm files in this repository: specialMatrix.m, Simpson.m, luFactor.m, falsePosition.m, and linearRegression.m.
