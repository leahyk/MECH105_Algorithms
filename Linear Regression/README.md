# Linear Regression
### This function is designed to compute the linear regression, line of best fit, for a data set.

#### INPUTS

* x: x-values for data set
* y: y-values for data set

#### OUTPUTS
* fX: x-values with outliers removed
* fY: y-values with outliers removed
* slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
* intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
* Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination

#### LIMITATIONS
* x and y must be the same length
