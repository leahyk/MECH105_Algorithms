# Simpson's 1/3 Rule
### This function is designed to numerically evaluate an integral with Simpson's 1/3 Rule, and if necessary use the trapazoidal rule as well.

#### INPUTS

* x: the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y: the vector of function values with respect to x

#### OUTPUTS
* I: the numerical integral calculated

#### LIMITATIONS
* x and y must be the same length
* x must be equally spaced
